# Problem 1
```{r}
subway_data = 
  read_csv(
    "data/Subway.csv", 
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

The dataset contains the following variables:`r names(subway_data)`. I used janitor::clean_names to do the basic cleaning. The dimension of the dataset is `r nrow(subway_data)`*`r ncol(subway_data)`. These data are not "tidy": route number should be a variable, as should route..

```{r}
subway_distinct = distinct(subway_data, line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

There are `r nrow(subway_distinct)` stations. 

```{r}
ada_compliant = filter(subway_distinct, ada == 'TRUE')
entry_without_vending = 
  filter(subway_distinct, vending == "NO") %>%
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
```

`r nrow(ada_compliant)` stations are ADA. `r 100*(nrow(entry_without_vending)/nrow(subway_distinct))`% of station entrances without vending allow entrance.

Lastly, we write a code chunk to identify stations that serve the A train, and to assess how many of these are ADA compliant. As a first step, we tidy the data as alluded to previously; that is, we convert `route` from wide to long format. After this step, we can use tools from previous parts of the question (filtering to focus on the A train, and on ADA compliance; selecting and using `distinct` to obtain dataframes with the required stations in rows).
```{r}
subway_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct

subway_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A", ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```


# Problem 2

# Read and clean the Professor Trash Wheel sheet

#Combine two dataset
```{r}
combine_data = 
  left_join(trash_data, professor_data, by = "date")
combine_data
```

## The trash_wheel data set has `r nrow(trash_data)` observations of `r ncol(trash_data)` variables. The key variables are `r names(trash_data)`. The total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020 is `r sum(pull(trash_data,sports_balls, year == 2020))` `r sum(pull(filter(trash_data, year == 2020), sports_balls))`.

## The professor trash wheel data set has `r nrow(professor_data)` observations of `r ncol(professor_data)` variables. The key variables are `r names(professor_data)`. The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is `r sum(pull(professor_data, weight_tons))` tons.

## The combined data set has `r nrow(combine_data)` observations of `r ncol(combine_data)` variables.

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

## Pols-month dataset has `r nrow(pols_data)` observtions of `r ncol(pols_data)` variables. It contains the number of presidents who are democratic or republican at certain given time. For example, at a given month and year, whether the president belongs to democratic or republican party, and the number of republican or democratic governors, senators and representatives.

## Snp dataset has `r nrow(snp_data)` observations of `r ncol(pols_data)` variables. It introduces the Standard & Poorâ€™s stock market index, which shows the closing values of the S&P stock index on the associate date.

## Unemployment dataset has `r nrow(unemploy_data)` observations of `r ncol(unemploy_data)` variables. It reveals the percentage of unemployment at a given month and year.

## The resulting data set has `r nrow(pols_snp_unemploy)` observations of `r ncol(pols_snp_unemploy)` variables. Year range is 1947 to 2015, and the key variables are `r names(pols_snp_unemploy)`.
